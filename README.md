Analysis Obsevations:

Based on the summary statistics table, we see that Ramicane and Capomulin had the smallest average and median tumor size, both about 10 mm^3 smaller than the other drug regimens. This could suggest they're the more effective treatments in the study.

We can see that Capomulin started to really take effect in reducing the tumors around test day 20. It's interesting to see the tumors continue to grow until around dat 20, but the decrease is not linear and actually incerases again before day 30. This could suggest it takes about 20 days for Capomulin to start working.

the correlation between mice weight and average tumor volume was 0.84. This suggests a fairly strong correlation between the weight and tumor size, and makes sense because larger tumors will probably weigh more and contribute to the mouse's total weight.
